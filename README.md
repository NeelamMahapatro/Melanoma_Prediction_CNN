#  Melanoma prediction using CNN
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. 
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.
It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Here we have to create a CNN model for the probelem statement.
- Melanoma cancer is one of the preominant skin cancer types that accounts for maximum death.
- If it is detected or suspected at early stages, it can reduce a lot of work and dermatologists can start dignosis.
The objective of this project is to analyse the dataset and come up with a CNN model to predict the cancer on basis of the image of the skin spot.
